### Thought Process ###

From an analytical standpoint the dataset is very massive and contains a significant portion of missing and unidentifiable data. In addition to this it contains a lot of columns with categorical, non-binary and non-continuous data. The main goal of this assignment was to clean, organize and prepare the data.  After this I then cleaned the data, removing any rows containing empty cells or containing "?". With the data respectively cleaned I moved forward with reformatting the 13 categorical columns with the created data dictionaries. Finally in an effort to simply show proof of concept all columns deemed "non-essential" to illustrating proof of concept were removed. The final new diabetes dataset was processed and saved.
